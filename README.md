+	Used four popular machine learning models to detect retina damages from public retina OCT images. All achieved average AUC value greater than 95%.
+	Polluted data with different levels of speckle-noise to represent the real-world working environment of OCT devices.
+	Analyzed the correlation of model structure and noise immunity. Provided the metric for choosing the best machine learning model in automated retina damage diagnosis.
